 * The hero call-to-action pair.

 * Both buttons share one base — same border, padding, and press response — and
 * differ only in fill. They were previously built from separate recipes, which
 * left the bordered one 2px taller than its neighbour, gave the other a
 * `hover:border-*` rule it could never apply (its border-width was 0), and let
 * only one of the two respond to touch.
